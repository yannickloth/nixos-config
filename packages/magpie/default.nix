# magpie (yetone/magpie) — "every agent's model, one place": a TUI/CLI tool
# (and optional menu-bar app) that points Codex/Claude Code/opencode/... at
# one local gateway (127.0.0.1:3425) and one model catalog.
#
# Not in nixpkgs, so it is packaged in-tree from the upstream source.
#
# This build is the terminal-only (`nogui`) variant. The GUI build links GTK 3
# + WebKitGTK 4.1 through cgo, but on this repo's target machines (Plasma +
# NVIDIA/CachyOS, WebKitGTK 2.52.6) the webview aborts or renders a blank white
# window regardless of backend/sandbox/DMA-BUF settings. The CLI/TUI provides
# the same gateway and model-switching functionality, so we use that.
#
# Building it here also means magpie's self-updater is bypassed: update by
# bumping `version`/`src` and rebuilding, not with `magpie update`.
